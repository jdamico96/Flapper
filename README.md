# Flapper


Flappy Bird-type Game by Joe D'Amico and Andrew Griffin

[Our Game](https://jdamico96.github.io/Flapper/)

## Introduction

Our final project was a basic version of the popular iPhone game *Flappy Bird*.  While there is no winning this game, the objective is to fly through as many walls as possible without touching one.  The score goes up every time you make it through a wall (our highest score was 46, FYI).  We used the p5.collide library to manage the interaction between the bird and the walls.  

## Instructions

The objective of this game is to make it through as many of the moving walls as possible.  Gravity will move the bird downwards, while the bird can flap (move upwards) when space bar is pressed.  If the bird comes into contact with one of the walls or goes off-screen by getting too high or too low, the game is over.  A final score is presented when the game is over.  To play again, simply refresh the page.
